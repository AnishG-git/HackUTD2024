    "overall_suggestion": "Investigate the root cause of high latency across multiple endpoints and consider implementing a combination of the following actions:\n\n1. **Optimize database queries**: Review database queries executed by each endpoint and optimize them to reduce the number of queries, improve indexing, and use efficient query patterns.\n2. **Reduce server load**: Check if the server is overloaded or if there are any resource-intensive processes running in the background. Consider scaling up the server or distributing the load across multiple servers.\n3. **Improve caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests to the server and improve response times.\n4. **Monitor and analyze logs**: Review server logs to identify any errors or issues that may be contributing to the high latency.\n5. **Consider load testing**: Perform load testing to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the endpoint for high traffic scenarios.\n6. **Optimize code**: Review and refactor code to eliminate any unnecessary computations or bottlenecks.\n7. **Implement error handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch and handle errors more effectively.\n8. **Monitor performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of the endpoints and system to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\n9. **Consider scaling**: Scale the server or add more instances to handle the load and reduce latency.\n10. **Review authentication mechanisms**: Review the authentication mechanisms in place and ensure that they are secure and efficient.\n\nBy implementing these actions, you can improve the performance of your endpoints, reduce latency, and provide a better user experience."
